ORocksDb
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/domsj/orocksdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/domsj/orocksdb)

This repository contains some ocaml bindings to the C api of [rocksdb](http://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/).
It is most certainly not complete. Not all available/implemented options have been tested.
Additions and fixes are always welcome.

The binding is used as part of https://github.com/openvstorage/alba.

In case this library is not sufficient for your needs, then feel free to extend it, or to have a look at one of the alternatives: https://github.com/ahrefs/ocaml-ahrocksdb and https://github.com/chetmurthy/ocaml-rocksdb.
